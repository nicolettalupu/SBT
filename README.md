# SBT

It is not finished yet because I am still figuring out which tool to use for this project. I have the nice interface, and the text is rea and stored in multiple strings, and I am now thinking of creating a DataBase for storing the data. Also, there are screenshots for the first window, but after you tap the Scan button,  an empty window pops up because I didn't manage yet to finish.
